# Note
Older versions of `protobuf` might be installed already. Hence, in order to ignore the conflict, we are using locally installed `protobuf`

# Steps
1. Download the `protobuf-3.5.0.tar.gz` from release page. The URL of the file is [here](https://github.com/ravijo/ros_protocol_buffer_tutorial/releases/download/1/protobuf-3.5.0.tar.gz)
1. Place extracted `protobuf-3.5.0.tar.gz` here. The directory structure should look as following:

```
lib
└── protobuf-3.5.0
    ├── bin
    ├── include
    └── lib
```
