# Note
Older version of `protobuf` might be installed already. Hence, in order to ignore the conflict, we are using locally install `protobuf`

# Steps
Place extracted `protobuf-3.5.0.tar.gz` here. The directory structure should look as following:

```
lib
└── protobuf-3.5.0
    ├── bin
    ├── include
    └── lib
```
